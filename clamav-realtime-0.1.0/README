"Clamav-realtime" is a program designed to protect you from threats in your home directory.


As soon as a new file is written, it is sent to the virus scanning engine which put in quarantine in case it is detected as a threat.

This software uses "libnotify" for notifications and "libclamav" as antivirus engine. 

It is developped as educational to familiarize myself with the "C language".

This one is functional but has not yet recursive mode, any improvement is welcome.

It is distributed under the terms of the "GNU GPL v3 license."
